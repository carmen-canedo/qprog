    "# Modular Exponentiation\n",
    "## General Notes\n",
    "    - Looking to solve X^Y mod N\n",
    "    - Central subroutine of **Shor's period finding algorithm** used for integer factorization\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "Implement a quantum circuit for modular exponentiation from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Limitations\n",
    "    - Unless stated otherwise, you are only allowed to use the gates X, CNOT, CCNOT and Multicontrolled-NOT. See Appendix A for an example of use of the Multicontrolled-NOT gate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Can implement additional auxiliary functions as long as the functions below are implemented.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For each implemented function, please give evidence that the implementation is correct by:\n",
    "        - initializing each input register with some number up to 4 bits, \n",
    "        - each auxiliary register with |0>\n",
    "        - measuring the output register to verify if the value is as expected\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Reuse qubits from auxiliary registers as much as possible.\n",
    "        - It is crucial that auxiliary registers are equal to |0> both at the beginning and at the end of computation of each function"
